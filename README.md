FIFA 21 Player Stats Analysis

Dataset: FIFA 21 Complete Player Dataset

This project explores FIFA 21 player statistics using Python for data analysis, visualization, and feature engineering. It demonstrates insights on player attributes, performance, and trends.

Project Overview


The dataset contains detailed information about FIFA 21 players, including age, nationality, club, overall rating, potential, wage, market value, and positions. The analysis aims to understand player performance, distribution of attributes, and extract actionable insights.

Key Tasks Performance

Data Exploration: Checked dataset structure, missing values, duplicates, and basic statistics.

Visualization: Plotted histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and boxplots to understand player distributions and trends.

Statistics & Analysis: Calculated mean, median, variance, correlation, and percentages for key player attributes.

Feature Engineering: Created new columns such as elite players, high growth, normalized values, and extracted primary positions.

NumPy & Linear Algebra: Performed vector operations, normalization, and dot products for numerical insights.

Insights: Identified top players, top clubs, common nationalities, and relationships between overall and potential ratings.

Tools & Libraries


Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

This analysis provides a foundation for deeper exploration of player performance and trends in FIFA 21.

Conclusion

Elite Players: Players with overall ≥ 85 are mostly concentrated in top European clubs.

Correlation: There’s a strong positive correlation between overall and potential – high overall players often have high potential.

Youth vs Experience: Younger players with high potential are valuable for future investments.

Wage vs Value: Not always proportional; some high potential players have lower wages but high market value.

Nationality Trends: Certain countries (like Brazil, Germany, Spain) produce more high-quality players.
